#Team profile gen.
#Description
 My goal was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The user is asked to describe the first member of their team when they open the app. The user enters the team member's name, role from a list (options include "Engineer," "Intern," and "Manager"), ID (any string), email address, and then another piece of information that varies depending on the role selected. If "Engineer" was chosen, the app will question the user for the team member's GitHub username; if "Intern," the user will be asked for the member's school; and if "Manager," the user will be asked for the team member's phone number.


Here is some video footage of me showing how it works and the html outcome that you get when you finish.
